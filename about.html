                            <h2>My Journey Into CS</h2>
                            <p>My path into computer science began unexpectedly as a kid building HTML websites, then completely forgetting about coding until I took Introduction to Digital Technology. That class reignited something in me—I started enjoying the backend of code throughout high school, working with JavaScript and eventually solving problems with Python.</p>
                            
                            <p>I'm graduating this fall with what I believe is a truly diverse background. I've intentionally worked across a wide range of disciplines—from product design and user research to back-end development and site reliability engineering. This isn't a lack of focus; it's a deliberate strategy to gain a comprehensive, 360-degree understanding of the entire software development lifecycle, from initial concept all the way to a deployed and performant application.</p>
                            
                            <p>For example, I started by learning about user research and how analysis can lead to identifying which features help users. Then I moved into the design of those features—specifically front-end design—and eventually into implementation, where I discovered how efficiency matters when thinking about application performance management.</p>
                            
                            <p>My internships, particularly at Raymond James, have been incredibly influential. There, I gained firsthand experience with real-world problems like threading issues and the critical importance of code efficiency. That experience solidified my belief that the best code isn't just functional—it's also robust and reliable.</p>
                            
                            <p>Academically, my concentration in both artificial intelligence and people has given me a unique perspective. My research on how human decision-making can be replicated by computers has taught me to think about the deeper, often unquantifiable nuances behind complex problems. I believe this ability to connect the technical with the human element is what allows me to consistently think outside the box and bring new, innovative ideas to the table.</p>
                            
                            <p>Ultimately, I'm passionate about what I do, and I'm always eager to learn, adapt, and bring a holistic perspective to any project I work on.</p>
